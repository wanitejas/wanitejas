## 🧠 What I Work On

- **AI & Intelligent Workflows**  
  - LLM-based assistants for FAQs and human-in-the-loop support.  
  - Document ingestion pipelines with OCR and automated field extraction (title, date, contact, etc.).

- **Full Stack Engineering**  
  - RESTful APIs, microservices, and distributed systems on **Azure, Docker, Kubernetes**.  
  - Responsive frontends with **React / React Native**, optimized for real-world usage and reliability.

- **Data, Analytics & MLOps**  
  - ML-powered analytics to detect bottlenecks and anomalous usage, driving infra cost savings and better scaling decisions.  
  - Deep learning for medical imaging (DenseNet-121 on 120K+ chest X-ray images for 14 lung diseases).

## 🚀 Projects

### 🩺 Detection of Lung Diseases using Deep Learning
- Built a CNN with **DenseNet-121** and transfer learning on **120K+** chest X-ray images.  
- Achieved **92% accuracy** and **0.843 AUROC** across **14 thoracic conditions**, with careful augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to reduce false positives/negatives.  
- Co-authored a paper published in **Elsevier** and presented at **IEEE ICAST 2020**.

### 📝 Real-Time Collaboration Platform
- Architected a real-time collaboration app similar to Google Docs using **React, TypeScript, Node.js, WebSockets**.  
- Used **Redis** for real-time state and designed conflict-resolution logic to cut edit conflicts by **~90%**.

### 💸 Expense Tracking App
- Built a real-time expense tracker with **Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB** and RESTful APIs.  
- Integrated third-party financial APIs for currency conversion and used TypeScript to improve development speed and reliability by ~**30%**.

### 🧩 AI-Powered Campus Portal Enhancements
- Developed an **LLM-based FAQ assistant** to support student queries (events, volunteering, resources), reducing repetitive staff workload.  
- Implemented an **AI-driven document ingestion pipeline** with Tesseract OCR and Python to auto-populate CMS entries from flyers and forms.
